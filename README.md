Introduction
------------

Cinder's Block system + OpenCV has always given me a problem.  I also prefer to use
CMake for my build system compared to using TinderBox from cinder.

I also get tired of remaking the wheel for each project, so I've created a bare
bones boilerplate project (no source, only cmake build stuff) that will get you
up and running quickly with Cinder + OpenCV.

This currently does not use the OpenCV block, but I will probably add that and include
a barebones application showing that Cinder and OpenCV work together once built.
