Introduction
------------

Cinder's Block system + OpenCV has always given me a problem.  I also prefer to use
CMake for my build system compared to using TinderBox from cinder.

I also get tired of remaking the wheel for each project, so I've created a bare
bones boilerplate project that will get you
up and running quickly with Cinder + OpenCV.

Currently tested on :

* Mac OSX Yosemite with OpenCV installed from homebrew and Cinder nextGL branch
